This is the Jekyll source configuration for the [OSLOÂ² public dissemination website](http://informatievlaanderen.github.io/OSLO/).

The website is hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Simple edits can be made in files and GitHub will run Jekyll to create the final website. For big changes, it is advised to [locally run Jekyll (on a linux machine)](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) to preview any changes: `bundle exec jekyll serve`. See the `_config.yml` for a needed change in order to get theming to work properly when running locally.
